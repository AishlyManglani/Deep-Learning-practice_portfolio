A full stack task manager app created using Bolt.diy. Used a gemini api key to work with bolt. The first step was to give a refined prompt for the web app including the needed features and it generated the entire web app. This app has the basic CRUD functionality. It allows you to add tasks along with the category(personal, work, miscellaneous), priority(low, medium, high) and the deadline. It adds it to upcoming tasks arranging in the order of priority from high to low and from there you could move tasks to the completed tasks section or delete a specific task.
