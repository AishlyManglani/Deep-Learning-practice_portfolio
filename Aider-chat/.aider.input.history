+I want to build a simple dull stack random quote generator usinf flask for backend and html, css, javascript for frontend. for backend create a flask api with an endpoint /random-quote that returnsa random quote. it should store quote in a sqlite database with fields 'id','text','author' and also add an endpoint /add-quote to insert new quotes.  for frontend create a html page with button that fetches random quote from the backend. it displays the quite and its author in a styled box. use javascript(fetch api) to call the backend when button is clickes. style is with basic css. generate the backend first then help with frontend
