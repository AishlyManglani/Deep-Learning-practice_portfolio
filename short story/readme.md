# Survey of Large Language Models in Mental Health Disorder Detection on Social Media

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting mental health disorders through social media analysis.

## Overview

Mental health disorders are a growing concern globally. Social media platforms offer a wealth of data that can be analyzed to detect signs of mental health issues. LLMs, with their advanced natural language processing capabilities, have shown promise in this domain.

## Key Components

- **Applications of LLMs**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
- **Datasets Reviewed**: CLPsych, Reddit Mental Health datasets, Twitter-based corpora.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
- **Challenges**: Data privacy, model bias, generalizability.

## Future Directions

- Development of ethical guidelines for data usage.
- Enhancing model transparency and explainability.
- Creating more diverse and representative datasets.
